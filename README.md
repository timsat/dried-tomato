# dried-tomato (former Tomighty's develop branch) #

A desktop timer app for the [Pomodoro Technique®](http://pomodorotechnique.com)
written in C++ on top of [Qt 5](http://qt-project.org).

It's designed to be:

* Simple
* Non-distracting
* Unintrusive
* Reasonably configurable
* Extensible (with plugins)
* Cross-platform

When the application starts, a little tomato icon is shown on the system tray. Its color indicates
the current state of the timer. By clicking on the tray icon the main application menu pops up.
